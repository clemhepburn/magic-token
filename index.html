        Remember the red paperclip guy? <br/><br/>He started out with a paperclip and through some 14 trades, he ended up with a house. <br/>
        I remember visiting his <a href="http://oneredpaperclip.blogspot.com/">blog</a>, this must've been 2005 or so. 
        That memory has stuck with me, I found it so fascinating that he was able to do that. 
        It felt like a testament to creativity, collaboration, generosity. 
        <br/><br/>Recently, I have been in need of a pickup truck, because I would like to adventure in it, 
        visit some old friends, and do some soul searching. I was trying to come up with creative means to 
        achieve this goal, and I started to wonder recently if this would work in our modern day. I wonder 
        if our society still holds the levity that facilitated that project... 
        So, I'm trying it out! This is an experiment. <br/><br/>
      
      I am starting out with this 1979 Diamond Jubilee Subway Token. 
      I think this is a pretty special little trinket. 
      NYC enthusiasts or transit enthusiasts might find a great deal of joy in this commemorative token. 
      
      <br/>I wonder what I could trade it for?

      <br/><br/>On this website, I will document the trades I make, starting with this token. 
      I'm calling this project <em>"Magic Token"</em>. <br/>Please check back to see where this goes!
